### A module for alpha-reductions
   * We need to be able to tell whether 2 lambda terms are alpha equivalent 
### A module for beta-reductions
   * If a term has a fininte sequence of steps that lead to a beta normal form, we need
   to implemnt a procedure to perform the reductions and yield the b-nf
### A module for eta-reductions
    * i honestly have no idea how to do this
### A central module for dealing with parsing a file and running the interpreter 

* We can implement the interpreter and then bake some restricted lambda-terms 
   during startup

# What we need to learn:
   - how to parse files (A simple parsing algorithm should do fine for now, we aren't 
   looking for something too complex)
