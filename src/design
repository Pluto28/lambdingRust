### A module for alpha-reductions
   * We need to be able to tell whether 2 lambda terms are alpha equivalent 
### A module for beta-reductions
   * If a term has a fininte sequence of steps that lead to a beta normal form, we need
   to implemnt a procedure to perform the reductions and yield the b-nf
### A module for eta-reductions
    * i honestly have no idea how to do this

* We can implement the interpreter and then bake some restricted lambda-terms during startup
